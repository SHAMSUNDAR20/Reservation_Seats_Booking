# Train Seat Reservation System

This project is a simple train seat reservation system implemented in Python. It allows users to reserve seats in a coach with 80 seats, where each row has 7 seats except the last row, which has 3 seats. The system prioritizes booking seats in a single row if possible and finds the nearest available seats otherwise.

## Features

- Reserve up to 7 seats at a time.
- Prioritize booking seats in a single row.
- Display the current status of the seats.
- Continue booking until the coach is full.
